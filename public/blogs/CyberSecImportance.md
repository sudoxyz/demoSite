# What Is *Cyber* Security?

Cyber security refers to the practice of protecting systems, networks, data, and programs from digital attacks. These cyber attacks typically aim to access, alter, or destroy sensitive information, extort money from users, or disrupt regular business operations. Effective cyber security measures are increasingly challenging to implement, as there are now more devices connected to the internet than people, and attackers are becoming more innovative in their methods.

Cyber security is crucial in nearly every aspect of modern life, from personal finance to critical infrastructure, such as healthcare, energy, and transportation. Without adequate cyber security, individuals and organizations face significant risks, including data breaches, financial loss, identity theft, and reputational damage. For instance, a breach in a hospitalâ€™s system could compromise patient records, while an attack on a power grid could disrupt essential services for millions.

Many everyday objects in homes today are connected to the internet, these are known as IoT (Internet of Things) devices. Examples include  


- IP cameras  
- Coffee machines, dishwashers, ovens, etc.  
- Robotic vacuums (e.g., roomba)

Having many (and often unnecessary) devices connected to the internet increases the number of potential vulnerabilities in a network. The more devices there are, the greater the risk that one could be exploited, leading to a compromised network.  

 Most vulnerabilities in IoT devices are due to improper or poorly written code. Even with strong security measures in place, a device with insecure code can create entry points to a network that would otherwise not be there.

When purchasing IoT devices its important to think about weather or not the IoT functionality is important or not. For example a toothbrush doesn't need internet access whereas a IP camera (Such as ring) would.

### Examples of *Cyber* Security Measures

> **Firewalls**  
 A firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing traffic based on predetermined security rules. It acts as a barrier between trusted internal networks and untrusted external networks, blocking unauthorised and malicious access.  

> **Encryption**  
 Encryption is the process of converting data into a code to ensure that only authorised devices can read it. This is commonly used to secure communication channels (e.g., HTTPS for websites) and protect sensitive information like passwords and financial transactions.  

> **Backups**  
 A backup is a copy of data that is stored separately from the original, often used for recovery purposes in case of data loss due to accidental deletion, hardware failure, or cyber attacks. Regular backups are critical for protecting sensitive information. These can be stored both on-site (e.g., external hard drives) and off-site (e.g., cloud storage).

### How *Cyber* Security Is Used

> **Protecting Personal Information**  
 Cyber security measures like encryption and 2FA are used to safeguard personal data, such as bank accounts or social media profiles, from unauthorised access. As a safety net, backups are used to protect against ransomware attacks and data loss.  

> **Securing Business Networks**  
 Firewalls and intrusion detection systems are used by businesses to protect their internal networks from external threats and prevent data breaches.  

> **Infrastructure Security**  
 Cyber security is essential for protecting critical infrastructure like power grids, water supply systems, and transportation networks from cyber attacks that could cause widespread disruption.

## Technology Used in *Cyber* Security

Cyber security relies on a combination of hardware, software, and policies to protect systems and data. Below are some key technologies used in cyber security  


> **Firewalls**  
Firewalls act as a barrier between trusted internal networks and untrusted external networks. They monitor network traffic and block unauthorised access based on predefined rules.  


> **Encryption**  
 Encryption converts data into a coded format that can only be read by someone with the correct decryption key. This technology is used to secure communication channels, protect sensitive information during transit, and safeguard stored data.  

> **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**  
 IDS monitor network traffic for suspicious activity and alert administrators when potential threats are detected. These systems help in identifying and responding to cyber attacks in real-time to prevent any further damage.   

> **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**  
 MFA requires users to provide multiple forms of verification before accessing an account. This adds an extra layer of security beyond just a username and password, An example being a security code sent via SMS.  

> **Network Monitoring Tools**  
 These tools analyse network traffic for unusual patterns that may indicate a cyber attack. They help in identifying vulnerabilities, detecting intrusions, and responding to threats effectively.  

> **Secure Communication Protocols**  
 Protocols like HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) and SSH (Secure Shell) ensure secure communication over the internet by encrypting data during transmission.  

> **Backup Systems**  
 Backup systems are essential components of a robust cyber security strategy, providing protection against data loss due to cyber attacks, hardware failures, or accidental deletions. By creating copies of data that can be restored when needed, backup systems keep critical information and data from being lost permanently.

### How These Technologies Create Layers of Security

Cyber security is often implemented using a layered approach, where multiple technologies work together to create strong protection. For example  


- **Firewalls** act as the first line of defence, blocking unauthorised access.  

- **Encryption** ensures that even if data is intercepted, it cannot be read without the decryption key.  

- **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)** and **Network Monitoring Tools** detect and respond to potential threats in real-time.  

- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** adds an additional layer of security by requiring more than just a password.  

- **Backups** add a layer of security, preventing permanent data loss. Backuos are a very strong defence against crypters and ransomware attacks as well as other destructive attacks. Backups also help prevent accidental data loss (accidental deletion) as well as hardware related data loss.  


By combining these technologies, organisations can create multiple layers of defence, making it significantly harder for attackers to breach the system or cause damage. This layered approach is crucial because no single technology can provide complete protection against all cyber threats. Too many layers can also cause issues due to restrictions (such as firewalls blocking certain services), they could also require lots of effort to keep up to date and stable.
